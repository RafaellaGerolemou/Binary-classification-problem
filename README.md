# Binary-classification-problem

- The aim of this notebook is to to predict whether the interaction with a document lead to it being considered relevant (1) or not relevant (0).
- This notebook includes a random forest machine learning model, a dense 3 layer baseline neural network, a dense deep neural network and wide and deep neural network to deal with the binary classification task. Data augmentation techniques are used to optimize the performance of the models.
- Wide and Deep Neural Network is the best model with the F1 score of 0.93.
