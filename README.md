# Binary-classification-problem

- The aim of this notebook is to to predict whether the interaction with a document lead to it being considered relevant (1) or not relevant (0).
- This notebook includes:
  - Random forest machine learning model
  - Dense 3 layer baseline neural network
  - Dense deep neural network
  - Wide and deep neural network
  to deal with the binary classification task. Data augmentation techniques are used to optimize the performance of the models.
- Wide and Deep Neural Network is the best model with the F1 score of 0.93.
